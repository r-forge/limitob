Revisit animation. Documentation needs to be better. Code should
be *much* faster. Try not to mess around with the slots on the
orderbook class until we talk about it. When creating an animation,
figure out the start time. Then load the orderbook to that
moment. Then process new messages into that orderbook, modifying it in
place. Write out plots on whatever the desired schedule is. This may
require some new methods (and slots?) in the orderbook. Something like:

ob <- iterate(ob, sec = 2)

would take an orderbook (which has already been processed to row n in
the input file) and then process the next two seconds worth of
messages, giving us a new orderbook which is just two seconds
later. Similarly,

ob <- iterate(ob, msg = 5)

would do the same thing, but in "msg time," not clock time. Once you
have those functions, it becomes easy (?!) to create a loop which
iterates through either time or msgs, writes out a plot at each
moment, until it gets to the end. Then, the animation just loops
through those plots.

Needless to say, we want these functions to be very fast.

Also, where is the format of the input file documented? I know we
discuss this (quickly!) in the vignette, but this should also be
spelled out clearly in the code and the help pages. We may want to
revisit this format.

Look at returns.R. See extensive discussion in that file. We need
several new functions, the lowest level ones have no necessary
connection to orderbook objects. Conceptually, I should be able to
calculate the midpoint return for

You should start by familiarizing yourself with SVN (first three
chapters of Red Bean book) and then downloading the source from
R-forge. You will start out as a user. Can you get all the parts of
the package to work for you? Do the animations play? Can you
understand all the code?

I suspect that your first substantive project wil involve working with
the BATS data, but more on that later.

Revisit the class design. What should the slots be called? Do we
really need all of them? What should the format of the input data be?
We should probably provide a way to read data from BATS directly.

Start playing with the bats data. We should start a new project at
R-forge called "bats."
